<h1 class="page_header nav_transition_point">Our Team</h1>

<section class="our-approach-main">
    <p>Experienced.  Hard-working. Enthusiastic. Dedicated. Passionate.  These words perfectly describe the talented team at Storrington PR.  We work so closely with our clients that our relationship has become intrinsic and they often view us as an in house resource rather than an external agency.</p>

    <p>Our team is comprised of well-educated, experienced and knowledgeable travel professionals.  We pride ourselves on delivering a personal, bespoke service.  Because we know each luxury hotel, private island, restaurant, venue, golf course, villa and real-estate offering is different and unique, we expertly tailor our PR campaigns and strategies to deliver maximum return on investment.</p>

            <div>
                <p>Born and raised in England, Li Boatwright aspired to build her career in PR from the age of just 14.</p>
                <p>By the time she was in her late 20s, after gaining experience in leading public relations agencies in both the UK and USA, Li established her own agency, Storrington PR, with an international outlook and portfolio of clients in the luxury lifestyle and tourism sector.</p>
                <p>Li gained experience in the USA at a high-profile public relations agency in Los Angeles. Working within a busy team, she discovered her passion for luxury travel and lifestyle, successfully achieving PR objectives for premium brands.</p>
                <p>In the UK Li’s career in public relations has included assignment to an equally high-profile mix of clients, including managing the hospitality and tourism PR account for Chelsea Football Club; a spell at leading London-based public relations agency, RJH, founded by HRH Countess of Wessex (wife of Prince Edward); and managing the PR account of 5-star London hotel, The Lanesborough.</p>
                <p>Storrington PR was founded in August 2008. Li’s primary ambition was to challenge the industry standard of drenching editorial teams with client press releases, choosing instead to act strategically; taking time to build personal relationships with editors and journalists within the luxury travel and lifestyle market.</p>

                <p>Sarah is based in Miami and has worked with both Li and Kevin for over 5 years; she is a key member of the Storrington team. Sarah was based in the Seychelles for 8 years. As Business Development Manager for Desroches Island she appointed Storrington to undertake the UK public relations activities for the island in 2010. Following a move to Miami in 2012, Li invited her to join the Storrington team. Sarah’s knowledge of the tourism industry is second to none; what she doesn’t know about the tourism industry could be written on the back of a postage stamp! Sarah is Li’s right hand woman and works with her on all accounts; she is an esteemed member of the team.</p>

                <p>Following 18 years as a criminal lawyer working on several high profile legal cases, Kevin joined Storrington in 2009. His engaging personality makes him a sure fire hit with journalists, but it’s his legal background that sets his ability apart. During his years as a lawyer, Kevin mastered the skill of processing complex information into simple and compelling messages the jury believes in. Now, when it comes to advising clients on their communications strategy and developing messages to win over target audiences, it’s an open and shut case, jury finds for the client!</p>
                <p>When he’s not meeting with the media or liaising with clients, Kevin can be found overseeing the agency’s finances and preparing business contracts.</p>
