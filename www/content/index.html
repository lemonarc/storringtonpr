        <h2>PR doesn't just stand for Public Relations; it also stands for Personal Relations</h2>
        <h3>It is on this basis that Storrington PR, a dynamic, results-driven travel and lifestyle public relations consultancy  is built.</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="blurb_text">
        <p>Storrington PR is one of the UK travel and lifestyle sector’s best connected PR agencies.  We work with luxury hotels, private islands, events and venues, exclusive international hotel groups and lifestyle products to help them establish and maintain a strong presence in the UK market place. We’ve taken our offering beyond generic press relations, forming personal, one-to-one relationships with the leading journalists and editors in the UK luxury travel and lifestyle sectors. </p>
        <p>This sincere approach gives us the advantage in the busy newsroom. We pitch our news and story ideas to our media colleagues and discuss these with them, reaching the intended audience.  And because this information is communicated by a recognised, valued and reliable source, it stands in stark contrast to the unsolicited press releases other PR agencies bombard media with, which are often ignored since they haven’t taken the time to research their audience and pitch properly. </p>

        <h2>Why Do Hotels Need PR?</h2>
        <p>Many hotels neglect PR and they shouldn’t. An advert placed in a key target publication is one dimensional and doesn’t engage the reader. However, a feature placed by Storrington PR depicting your hotel in the same publication engages the reader, they immerse themselves in the article; they absorb the information and details about your hotel, what it offers, what they can experience. Hotel public relations can boost the awareness of your brand making your property stand out and the work of an experienced travel PR agency, such as Storrington PR can vastly improve your opportunities for success.</p>
