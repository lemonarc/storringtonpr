        <h2>Why Do Hotels Need PR?</h2>
        <p>Many hotels neglect PR and they shouldn’t. An advert placed in a key target publication is one dimensional and doesn’t engage the reader. However, a feature placed by Storrington PR depicting your hotel in the same publication engages the reader, they immerse themselves in the article; they absorb the information and details about your hotel, what it offers, what they can experience. Hotel public relations can boost the awareness of your brand making your property stand out and the work of an experienced travel PR agency, such as Storrington PR can vastly improve your opportunities for success.</p>
