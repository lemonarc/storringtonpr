        <p>“The exquisite villas of The Tongsai Bay Resort tumble down a green horseshoe-shaped hillside to a private beach and offer a real sense of seclusion. The free-form pool by the beach is a great hang-out for families while the half-moon shaped pool up the hill is reserved for adults.”</p>

        <p>“You can snorkel across a coral reef with a Finding Nemo-esque array of fish, kayak in a glass-bottomed boat, scuba-dive, whale-watch, enjoy a variety of nature walks and take a ‘Flats Lunch’, served to you ankle-deep in warm water on a deserted sand-bar. You can’t help coming nose to snout with nature. Fifty giant tortoises wander freely. Only one, called Grumpy Ivan, is aggressive.</p>
        <p>“I am disturbed one night by a strange beating sound. I rush down to the beach, where I am met by a giant hawksbill turtle striking her fins against the sand as she gives birth to around 150 eggs on the beach outside my bungalow. If she looks shocked, I look awed.”</p>

        <p>“Lakeside spa-ing just got swisher. This grande dame, built on the shores of Lac Leman in 1905… has added oodles of elan (velvet sofas, hypnotic swirly carpets, ornate cloistered ceilings) while keeping its history and heritage intact. The Spa Evian Source is something of a super-spa, with its lake views, 30 therapy rooms, steam room, sauna, aqua pool/gym and outdoor hydro-contact trail (series of Jacuzzis)”</p>

        <p>“There will be sunset drinks, an incredible lunch cooked on the low-tide salt flats, stargazing trips and a chance to watch horn-billed and green turtles lay their eggs in the sand beneath my room.”</p>

        <p>“Desroches is more Swallows & Amazons- chic than five-star finery: you’re given a bike on arrival; there’s no dress code; and you can leave your guilty conscience at the door – the resort has its own organic farm, solar panels and desalinisation plant, as well as an impressive sustainable building programme. And with only 48 villas sharing some 14km of cricket-whites-bright beaches, it’s easy to find a patch of sand to call your own.”</p>

        <p>“The Dolphin Bay is not just a fanciful name, dolphins genuinely leap out of the water in front of your balcony. If you were any nearer the Pacific, you would be in it. Originally designed as an oceanfront apartment building, the rooms are all unusually spacious with imposing solid wooden front doors. The overall look is of a stylish apartment complex, notably better looking than many of the other oceanfront properties in this area.”</p>

        <p>“Zawadi and The Palms of The Zanzibar Collection are exceptionally private, intimate and are both set in tranquil, peaceful locations, renowned for their bespoke service, refined elegance and pure white sandy beaches.”</p>

        <p>“Perched upon a cliff above, arguably, Zanzibar’s most picturesque cove, Zawadi wins you over immediately with its bougainvillea-filled gardens and arresting Indian Ocean views. There are only nine villas here so you’ll only ever share this idyllic enclave with a handful of other guests. It feels incredibly intimate, yet spacious enough to avoid feeling like you’re short on privacy.”</p>

        <p>“With 14 kilometres of sand, the island is one of the most beautiful in the Indian Ocean, housing 20 luxury suites and 20 villas. Myriad diving opportunities provide the visual wonder of gliding rays and a labyrinth of sea caves and columns, where spongy and Gorgonian fan corals abound.”</p>

        <p>“Dolphin Bay offers honeymooners a unique Californian experience, combining old-world Americana charm and romance in picturesque surroundings on the edge of the Pacific Ocean. The all-suite resort has luxurious fully equipped accommodations, pampering couples’ treatments at The Spa, award-winning restaurant and a plethora of activities just minutes away.”</p>

        <p>“'Paradise' is an overused word in travel features, but in this case it really does apply. When you live in a major city, as I do, you can't envisage anywhere so totally deserted, unspoiled and Robinson Crusoe-esque can exist. But it does, and it’s here on Alphonse. It's like a Bounty advert – only better.”</p>
