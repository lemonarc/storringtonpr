    <h1>Expertise</h1>

    <div class="expertise_blurb">
        <p>You’ll notice that Storrington Communications’ approach is different from traditional PR agencies. We don't just issue countless press releases, and we don't bombard journalists with irrelevant material. We only promote newsworthy content that is innovative and revealing. For us, it’s not only about telling the story by press release, we ensure your information is placed to gain the maximum brand benefit and discuss it with the very journalists we know will be interested.</p>

        <p>To us, service is everything. At Storrington PR we not only provide unequalled levels of service, we are knowledgeable and work closely with each client to develop measureable objectives and strategic campaigns that deliver results and ultimately drive our clients' business forward. Because we distribute only quality news, we’ve achieved an enviable reputation of integrity, reliability and trust with the media that we target. They believe in us, and are prepared to talk to us more and listen for longer. This means our clients get more accurate news stories and features, rich in positive ‘brand-building’ detail.</p>

            <p>It's not rocket science, but a one size fits all approach to PR doesn't work!!  Whether you are a large venue that can accommodate 1000 delegates or one that can host 100, we will identify your needs and strengths and will expertly communicate these to your desired target market.  We have successfully executed PR campaigns for One Great George Street and Honesty Cookery School.  Two completely different ends of the venue spectrum yet with the same goal: to generate awareness and increase bookings.  Because we listen and are passionate about what we do, Storrington PR created two very different strategies for each venue, yet positively exceeded the expectations for each client. 
        </p>
            <p>Our collective experience has led us to working with a selection of the finest names in the UK restaurant industry, from Michelin starred restaurants to country pubs. We have created and enhanced the profile of many restaurants throughout the UK. Our industry knowledge is vast, we pride ourselves on being different and are passionate about.  This what makes Storrington PR successful and enables us to deliver outstanding results and gain extraordinary levels of coverage.</p>
