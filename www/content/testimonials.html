        <blockquote>
            <p>We contracted Storrington PR in July, 2012 to represent the Evian Resort to the UK media. Storrington PR exceeded all our expectations in terms of securing news coverage and providing high-value strategic counsel for Evian Resort. We are very impressed by the company’s ability to secure positive coverage nationwide and to over-deliver on its promises. Due to economic reasons, we stopped working with Storrington PR at the end of December 2014.</p>
            <p>During this year "off", their passion for the job and real professionalism prevailed and although they were not representing us, they continued to think about us by sending us requests and replying to journalists regarding Evian Resort.</p>
            <p>With a great pleasure, we re-appointed Storrington PR to represent Evian Resort in 2016. We did not hesitate to come back to them as they deliver a personal and professional service and their passion for work shines through. They go above and beyond and nothing is too much trouble for them.</p>
            <p>I really appreciated the dedication and professionalism of Storrington PR and would recommend them to anyone who is looking for UK public relations representation.</p>

            <p>Storrington Communications have provided me with a huge amount of coverage for my books and other businesses. The coverage has been both trade and consumer coverage.</p>
            <p>Being a small agency you get a very personal service from Storrington Communications. I have over the years built up a close relationship with Li Boatwright and can call her to discuss initial ideas for coverage. She always sounds thing out before she tries things, so I feel I have a final say on any decision.</p>
            <p>Storrington Communications are always ahead of the game when it comes to news releases, reacting quickly to news developments or being proactive when it comes to certain issues. I have worked with Li since 2008 and would recommend her hard work and dedication.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>We had the privilege and pleasure of working with Li Boatwright and Storrington PR for the past five years. Li and Storrington were an integral part of our sales and marketing team and played an instrumental role in improving the publicity and coverage of Desroches Island Lodge Limited (“Desroches”) and, consequentially growing our revenue through improved occupancies.</p>
            <p>Personal, approachable and professional sums up Storrington PR. Li and her team consistently provided us with a stream of coverage in target publications that enhanced our brand and created awareness of our property both in the UK and internationally. They worked so closely with us to develop creative ideas and new marketing concepts and, coupled by always going the extra mile, resulted in us never viewing Storrington as an external agency, but rather a part of our own internal team.</p>
            <p>It is the high level of personal service and sacrifice that sets Storrington apart. Nothing was ever too much trouble and no deadline unachievable for Li. Her enthusiastic approach is refreshing and her passion for Desroches was evident throughout the whole five years we worked with Storrington.</p>
            <p>We wish Li and Storrington PR all the very best and unequivocally recommend their services.</p>
