            <p>We contracted Storrington PR in July, 2012 to represent the Evian Resort to the UK media. Storrington PR exceeded all our expectations in terms of securing news coverage and providing high-value strategic counsel for Evian Resort and our resort. We are very impressed by the company’s ability to secure positive image nationwide and to over deliver on its promises.</p>
            <p>During those years of collaboration, I appreciated the dedication and professionalism of Storrington PR and would recommend it for similar positions. We have stopped to work with Storrington PR due to economic reasons, and if those would improve, we will work again with Storrington PR in the future.</p>

            <p>Storrington Communications have provided me with a huge amount of coverage for my books and other businesses. The coverage has been both trade and consumer coverage.</p>
            <p>Being a small agency you get a very personal service from Storrington Communications. I have over the years built up a close relationship with Li Boatwright and can call her to discuss initial ideas for coverage. She always sounds thing out before she tries things, so I feel I have a final say on any decision.</p>
            <p>Storrington Communications are always ahead of the game when it comes to news releases, reacting quickly to news developments or being proactive when it comes to certain issues. I have worked with Li since 2008 and would recommend her hard work and dedication.</p>

            <p>We had the privilege and pleasure of working with Li Boatwright and Storrington PR for the past five years. Li and Storrington were an integral part of our sales and marketing team and played an instrumental role in improving the publicity and coverage of Desroches Island Lodge Limited (“Desroches”) and consequentially growing our revenue through improved occupancies.</p>
            <p>Personal, approachable and professional sums up Storrington PR. Li and her team consistently provided us with a stream of coverage in target publications that enhanced our brand and created awareness of our property both in the UK and internationally. Li and Storrington worked so closely with us to develop creative ideas and new marketing concepts, coupled by always going the extra mile, resulting in us never viewed Storrington as an external agency, but rather a part of our own internal team. It is the high level of personal service and sacrifice that sets Storrington apart.</p>
            <p>Nothing was ever too much trouble and no deadline unachievable for Li. Her enthusiastic approach is refreshing and her passion for Desroches was evident throughout the whole five years we worked with Storrington.</p>
            <p>We wish Li and Storrington PR all the very best and unequivocally recommend their services.</p>
