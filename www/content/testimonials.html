                <p> "Here at Spear's Wealth Management Magazine, we know Storrington PR very well. Li and her team are a joy to work with! They are professional and above all, without doubt know the luxury industry. This is a huge advantage as they always pitch relevant information to us and do not waste our time. If I was going to invest money in a UK PR agency to promote my product, destination or company, I would choose Storrington PR as their personal touch; contacts and friendly manner make all the difference."</p>

I deal with several travel PR companies each year and I found Li to be among the most professional, friendly and efficient that I have ever come across.

                <p>"I have known Li Boatwright for approximately 12 years and fully supported her when she founded her company, Storrington PR, seven years ago. We have worked on numerous promotions for her clients in Bentley and also in Sunseeker magazine. Li has proved herself extremely hard working, reliable and totally committed to her clients beyond the call of duty giving 1000% on every occasion. I would not hesitate in recommending her to anyone considering a wise investment in PR."</p>
