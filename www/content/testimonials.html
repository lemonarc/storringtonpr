                <p>"I have known Li Boatwright for approximately 12 years and fully supported her when she founded her company, Storrington PR, seven years ago. We have worked on numerous promotions for her clients in Bentley and also in Sunseeker magazine. Li has proved herself extremely hard working, reliable and totally committed to her clients beyond the call of duty giving 1000% on every occasion. I would not hesitate in recommending her to anyone considering a wise investment in PR."</p>
